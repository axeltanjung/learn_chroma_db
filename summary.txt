**Recipe Title:** Spaghetti and Meat Sauce (Claimed to be the "only one you'll ever make again" and "best ever")

**Key Features:**
*   **Time:** 30 minutes total preparation and cooking.
*   **Health:** Healthy, loaded with veggies.
*   **Flavor:** Delicious, full of flavor, deep and rich taste.
*   **Convenience:** Easy weeknight dinner.
*   **Secret:** Veggies chopped fine enough that "allergic to vegetables" family members won't notice.
*   **Technique:** Pasta finishes cooking *in the sauce* for maximum flavor.

**Ingredients:**

*   **Veggies:**
    *   Onion (rough chop)
    *   Garlic (5 cloves)
    *   Carrot (large, peeled or not, good wash)
    *   Celery (similar size chunks, including leaves)
*   **Fat:** Olive oil (generous "glug")
*   **Meats:**
    *   1 lb Ground Beef (85/15 fat content recommended for balance)
    *   0.5 lb Italian Sausage (2 links, casing removed)
*   **Seasonings & Sauce:**
    *   Salt (to taste, for cooking veggies)
    *   1 tbsp Dried Italian Seasoning
    *   Crushed Fennel (optional, for "sausy but sweet" flavor)
    *   1 whole can Tomato Paste (for deep, rich, concentrated flavor)
    *   1 whole can Crushed Tomatoes
    *   Water (from rinsing tomato can)
    *   **Secret Ingredient:** Fish Sauce (for Umami saltiness, shortcut for long-cooked flavor)
*   **Pasta:** Spaghetti (boiled half the time on the box)
*   **Finishing:**
    *   Grated Parmesan Cheese
    *   Freshly chopped Parsley
    *   Freshly chopped Basil
    *   Crushed Red Pepper (optional, for hint of spiciness)
    *   Reserved Pasta Water (to help sauce cling to pasta)

**Preparation Steps:**

1.  **Prep Veggies:**
    *   Rough chop onion, carrot, celery into similar size pieces.
    *   Place onion, garlic, carrot, and celery into a food processor.
    *   Pulse until small pieces (don't over-process to mush).
2.  **Cook Veggies:**
    *   Add a "nice glug" of olive oil to a large heavy pot over medium-high heat until shimmery.
    *   Add chopped vegetables, season with salt to "make it sweat" and caramelize. Cook until soft and brown bits form.
3.  **Add Meats:**
    *   Add ground beef (85/15) and Italian sausage (casing removed) to the pot.
    *   Break up meat and combine with veggies. Cook until browned.
    *   (Note: Veggies "cling" to meat, tenderizes meat in short time).
4.  **Add Flavorings:**
    *   Add 1 tbsp dried Italian seasoning and optional crushed fennel.
    *   Add 1 whole can of tomato paste. Cook, stirring, until aromatic and tomato paste caramelizes slightly.
5.  **Add Liquids & Simmer:**
    *   Add 1 whole can of crushed tomatoes.
    *   Rinse the crushed tomato can halfway with water and add to the pot.
    *   Add fish sauce (secret ingredient for umami).
    *   Scrape any caramelized bits from the bottom of the pot ("that is the flavor!").
    *   Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
6.  **Cook Pasta:**
    *   While sauce simmers, boil spaghetti for *half* the time specified on the box.
    *   Reserve some pasta water.
7.  **Combine Pasta & Sauce:**
    *   Add the partially cooked spaghetti directly into the simmering meat sauce.
    *   Add reserved pasta water as needed to help the sauce cling to the pasta.
    *   Ensure spaghetti is fully submerged.
    *   Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes in the sauce until fully cooked and flavored.
8.  **Serve & Garnish:**
    *   Serve immediately.
    *   Finish with grated Parmesan cheese, fresh chopped parsley, and fresh chopped basil.
    *   Optional: Add crushed red pepper for a hint of spiciness.
